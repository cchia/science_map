By drawing an 'electric spark' from a metal key attached to the wet kite string, he proved definitively that 'lightning' and 'static electricity' (from a Leyden jar) were the exact same phenomenon. This discovery led directly to his invention of the 'Lightning Rod', one of the most significant practical inventions of the 18th century.",

      "text_en": "Franklin hypothesized lightning was a massive electrical discharge, identical to a spark from a Leyden jar (`leyden_jar_1745`). To 'catch' it, he flew a kite (with a metal wire at the top) into a storm cloud. The rain wet the hemp kite string, making it conductive. The charge flowed down the string and stopped at a metal 'key', which was attached to an insulating 'silk ribbon' that Franklin held to protect himself. When he brought his knuckle near the key, a *spark* jumped. He then used this 'celestial fire' to charge a Leyden jar, proving it had all the same properties as laboratory-made electricity."

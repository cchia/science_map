He asked the core question: 'What is the Arche (fundamental substance)?' His answer was 'Water'. His student, Anaximander, proposed the more abstract 'Apeiron' (the boundless).

        "text_en": "Thales's most famous achievement was predicting the solar eclipse of May 28, 585 BC, allegedly using astronomical knowledge he learned from the Babylonians. The eclipse occurred during a battle between the Lydians and the Medes, who were so terrified they immediately stopped fighting. This event cemented Thales's reputation and demonstrated that the cosmos was understandable through reason and observation, not just the whims of gods. This belief—that the cosmos is knowable—was the core of the Milesian School (Thales, Anaximander, Anaximenes) and the beginning of science."

He looked for the 'main ingredient' of everything and guessed 'Water' (since everything needs it). His student Anaximander disagreed and guessed it was something infinite and abstract. Whether they were right or wrong doesn't matter; they started the tradition of *debate and evidence* over *myth*."

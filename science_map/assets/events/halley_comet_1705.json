      "text_en": "Edmond Halley, Newton's friend and the financier of his 'Principia', published his 'Synopsis of the Astronomy of Comets' in 1705. He was the first person to apply Newton's new laws of gravity (`newton_gravity_1687`) to comets. After laborious calculations, he noticed the orbits of comets seen in 1531, 1607, and 1682 were remarkably similar. He made the bold hypothesis that these were not three separate comets, but the *same comet* on a giant elliptical path. He then made a stunning scientific prediction: the comet would return in late **1758**.",

      "text_en": "It was Halley who visited Newton in 1684 and asked him what orbit an inverse-square force would produce. Newton's reply ('an ellipse') and his admission that he had already calculated it, stunned Halley. Halley immediately paid for and managed the publication of Newton's 'Principia' (`newton_gravity_1687`). To 'prove' the theory in the book, Halley undertook the massive task of calculating the orbits of 24 historical comets. In doing so, he saw the pattern. His calculation was so precise it even accounted for the 'perturbations' (gravitational tugs) from Jupiter and Saturn, which he predicted would slightly delay the comet. He predicted its arrival for late 1758 or early 1759.",

Halley, being Newton's best friend, believed Newton's new law of gravity worked for *everything*.

He looked at old records and saw the comets from 1531, 1607, and 1682 (all ~76 years apart) looked identical. He made a bet: 'I predict it will come back in 1758.' 50 years later, it did. Halley proved that comets are just 'ghost trains' of the solar system, and they run on a schedule.",

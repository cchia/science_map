        "text_en": "Torricelli, a student and assistant to the aged Galileo, conducted a famous experiment in 1643. He filled a long glass tube (sealed at one end) with mercury and inverted it into a dish of mercury. He observed the column fell to a height of ~76 cm, leaving an empty space at the top of the tube. He correctly deduced that the 'atmospheric pressure' (the weight of the air) on the outside dish was supporting the 76 cm column, and that the space at the top was a 'vacuum'.",

        "text": "这个实验的灵感来自于一个现实问题：佛罗伦萨的矿工发现，他们的抽水泵最多只能把水抽到10米高。伽利略曾思考过这个问题，但未解。托里拆利猜想，这是因为“大气压强”只能支撑起10米高的水柱。由于水银比水重约13.6倍，他推断大气压应该只能支撑起约 (10 / 13.6) ≈ 0.76米（76厘米）的水银柱。他的实验完美地证实了这一点。管顶留下的空间，即“托里拆利真空”，无可辩驳地证明了亚里士多德“自然厌恶真空”的信条是错误的。",
        "text_en": "The experiment was inspired by a real-world problem: miners in Florence found their suction pumps could not lift water more than 10 meters (34 feet). Galileo had pondered this, but Torricelli hypothesized it was because the 'weight of the air' could only support a 10m column of water. Since mercury is ~13.6 times denser than water, he reasoned the air should only be able to support a column of mercury ~76 cm (10m / 13.6) high. His experiment proved this perfectly. The space left at the top, the 'Torricellian vacuum', was definitive proof that Aristotle's dogma 'nature abhors a vacuum' was wrong."

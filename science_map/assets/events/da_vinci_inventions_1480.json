      "text_en": "After moving to Milan around 1482, Leonardo da Vinci's genius as an engineer—not just an artist—flourished. For nearly two decades, he filled thousands of notebook pages (codices) with designs centuries ahead of their time: 'flying machines' (ornithopters based on bird anatomy), 'helicopters' (the aerial screw), 'armored cars' (tanks), diving suits, and precise studies of human anatomy. He uniquely merged mechanical engineering with meticulous observation of nature.",

      "text_en": "Leonardo's 'Job Application': When he wrote to Ludovico Sforza, Duke of Milan, for a job, he listed a long catalog of military and civil engineering projects he could build (portable bridges, siege weapons, water systems). Only at the *very end* of the letter did he add, '...in painting, also, I can do everything that may be done.' He saw himself as an engineer first. In Milan, he became obsessed with flight, dissecting birds to understand their muscle and bone structure, convinced that 'a bird is an instrument working in accordance with mathematical law,' and that humans could therefore build a machine to fly.",

He drew all these ideas in notebooks, effectively designing helicopters, tanks, and robots 400+ years before they were actually built. He was an engineer from the future who just happened to be a great painter.",

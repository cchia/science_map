He developed the 'Socratic Method' (Elenchus), a form of questioning designed to reveal contradictions in his interlocutors' beliefs, forcing them to examine their own knowledge and admit their own ignorance. His famous maxim is: 'The unexamined life is not worth living.'",

        "text_en": "Socrates would wander the Agora, questioning anyone who claimed wisdom. He would ask a general, 'What is courage?' The general might answer, 'Holding your ground.' Socrates would reply, 'But what of a strategic retreat? Is that not also courageous?' He would continue until the general admitted his definition was flawed. Socrates believed this 'admission of ignorance' was the first step to wisdom. However, this practice of exposing the ignorance of powerful people eventually led to his death. In 399 BC, he was tried and executed by Athens for 'corrupting the youth' and 'impiety'."

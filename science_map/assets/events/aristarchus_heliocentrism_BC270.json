Archimedes wrote: '[Aristarchus's] hypotheses are that the fixed stars and the Sun remain unmoved, that the Earth revolves about the Sun...' The theory was universally rejected for 1,800 years because it contradicted Aristotelian physics (if the Earth moved, why don't we feel it?) and lacked observable 'stellar parallax' (a shift in star positions)."

He used the geometry of a half-moon (which forms a right-angle triangle with the Earth and Sun) to calculate the Sun's distance. His geometry was perfect, but his measurements were off. He concluded the Sun was 20x bigger than Earth (it's really 109x), but this was enough to convince him the tiny Earth shouldn't be the center."

Observation: If the Earth orbits the Sun, nearby stars should 'wobble' back and forth against distant stars over the year (parallax). They could not observe this, so they (incorrectly) concluded the Earth must be stationary."

      "text_en": "Wilhelm Wien proposed a formula, based on classical thermodynamics, to describe the spectral distribution of 'black-body radiation'. His formula (the 'Wien Approximation') worked *perfectly* for experimental data at *short* wavelengths (high frequencies, like visible light and UV), and successfully avoided the 'Ultraviolet Catastrophe'. However, it *failed* at *long* wavelengths (infrared), as shown by the experiments of Lummer and Pringsheim (`lummer_black_body_1899`). This 'half-right' law was the final, critical stepping stone for Max Planck's quantum formula (`planck_quantum_1900`).",

      "text": "19世纪末，物理学的最大难题是“黑体辐射”。当时的“瑞利-金斯定律”(Rayleigh-Jeans Law) 预测，热物体应在紫外线波段释放无限能量（“紫外灾难”），这显然是错的。维恩通过热力学论证，提出了一个新公式。这个公式在短波长（紫外和可见光）区域表现完美，成功地让能量在无穷大处降为零。一时间，物理学家们（包括普朗克本人）都认为维恩已经解决了这个问题。然而，`lummer_black_body_1899` 的高精度实验很快就表明，维恩的公式在“红外线”区域是错的。物理学陷入了僵局：一个公式（瑞利-金斯）在长波长正确，另一个公式（维恩）在短波长正确。普朗克的工作就是找到一个能“统一”这两者的公式。",
      "text_en": "In the late 19th century, the 'black-body' problem was physics' biggest mystery. The classical 'Rayleigh-Jeans Law' predicted infinite energy at short wavelengths (the 'Ultraviolet Catastrophe'), which was absurd. Wien, using arguments from thermodynamics, proposed a new formula. This formula was *perfect* at short wavelengths (UV/visible) and correctly predicted the energy would fall to zero, solving the catastrophe. For a brief time, physicists (including Planck) thought Wien had solved it. But the high-precision experiments of `lummer_black_body_1899` soon proved Wien's law was *wrong* in the 'infrared' (long-wavelength) region. Physics was now stuck: one law (Rayleigh-Jeans) worked for red, and one (Wien) worked for blue. Planck's job was to find one law that worked for both."

      "text_en": "Hooke used his own compound microscope to look at everything he could find: snowflakes, the point of a needle, a razor's edge, insects' eyes, plants, and even urine crystals. His most *famous* observation was of a flea, which he drew in a giant, terrifying fold-out illustration, making it look like a monster. His most *important* observation, however, was of cork. He saw it was made of a 'great many little Boxes'. This reminded him of the 'cells' (small rooms) that monks lived in at a monastery. He therefore named the structures 'cells'. He was only seeing the dead cell walls of a plant, but he had named the fundamental unit of life.",

He saw a flea looked like an armored monster, a fly's eye was made of hundreds of tiny eyes, and even a piece of cork looked like a honeycomb. He drew what he saw and published it. His book was like the first 'postcard from the microscopic world' ever sent to humanity, and it blew everyone's mind. When he saw the 'little rooms' in the cork, he called them 'cells', and the name stuck.",

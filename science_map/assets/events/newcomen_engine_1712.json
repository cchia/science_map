      "text": "托马斯·纽科门发明并建造了第一台具有商业实用价值的蒸汽机，被称为“大气蒸汽机”。这种发动机利用蒸汽冷凝产生的“真空”和“大气压强”来驱动活塞。虽然效率极低，但它是第一台能够持续做功的机器，主要用于从煤矿中抽水。它为后来的工业革命奠定了基础，也是詹姆斯·瓦特（James Watt）后来进行革命性改进的原型机。",
      "text_en": "Thomas Newcomen invented and built the first commercially practical steam engine, known as the 'Atmospheric Engine'. It used condensing steam to create a partial vacuum, allowing atmospheric pressure to push the piston down. While extremely inefficient, it was the first machine to provide continuous power and was used primarily to pump water out of mines. It laid the foundation for the Industrial Revolution and was the engine James Watt would later radically improve.",

      "text": "纽科门的设计是为了解决一个致命问题：煤矿越挖越深，地下水淹没了矿井。他的机器工作原理是：蒸汽被注入活塞下方的气缸；然后，一股冷水被喷入气缸，使蒸汽迅速冷凝（体积骤缩），在气缸内产生部分真空。此时，外部的“大气压强”（空气的重量）就会猛地将活塞向下推，拉动另一端的抽水泵。这个过程不断重复。这种“在同一气缸内先加热再喷冷水”的设计，浪费了巨量的热能，但它确实*能用*。",
      "text_en": "Newcomen's design solved a critical problem: coal mines were flooding as they got deeper. His engine worked by injecting steam into a cylinder below a piston. Then, a jet of cold water was sprayed in. This condensed the steam, creating a partial vacuum. The 'atmospheric pressure' (the weight of the air) outside then powerfully pushed the piston *down*, pulling the water pump on the other end of a beam. This process of heating, then cooling, the same cylinder was incredibly wasteful, but it *worked*."

      "text_en": "Newcomen's engine was like a giant syringe. Step 1: Fill the syringe with steam. Step 2: Spray cold water inside. The steam instantly vanishes (condenses), creating a vacuum. Step 3: The *weight of the air* outside (atmospheric pressure) *slams* the piston down. This downward push is what pumps the water. It wasn't a 'steam-push' engine; it was an 'air-press' engine.",

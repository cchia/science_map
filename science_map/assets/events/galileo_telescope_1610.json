        "text_en": "In 1609, Galileo heard of a 'spyglass' invented by the Dutchman Hans Lippershey. Without ever seeing it, Galileo built his own 3x version overnight from description alone, and quickly improved it to ~20x. When he pointed this new tool at the night sky, what he saw would change the world forever. His most shocking discovery was Jupiter: he saw three (and later four) tiny 'stars' in a line near it. Watching over several nights, he had a stunning realization—they were *orbiting* Jupiter. This proved that Earth was not the center of all motion in the universe."

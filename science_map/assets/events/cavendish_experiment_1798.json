    "text": "1798年，英国科学家亨利·卡文迪许（Henry Cavendish）进行了著名的“卡文迪许实验”。这是人类历史上第一次在实验室中测量两个物体之间的微弱引力。通过使用一个极其灵敏的“扭秤”(Torsion Balance)，他成功测量了铅球之间的引力，从而计算出了地球的平均密度（进而推算出了地球的质量）。这项实验后来也被视为对“万有引力常数”(G) 的首次测量。",
    "text_en": "In 1798, British scientist Henry Cavendish performed the famous 'Cavendish experiment'. It was the first time in history that the tiny force of gravity between two masses was measured in a laboratory. Using an incredibly sensitive 'torsion balance', he successfully measured the attraction between lead spheres to calculate the 'Density of the Earth' (and subsequently its mass). This experiment is also retrospectively viewed as the first measurement of the 'Gravitational Constant' (G).",

  "story": {
    "text": "这个实验的设备最初是由约翰·米歇尔（John Michell）设计的，但他去世前未能完成。卡文迪许继承并改进了这个装置。实验极其困难，因为铅球之间的引力非常微弱（大约只有一颗沙子重量的1/50000），任何微小的气流或震动都会破坏测量。为了消除干扰，卡文迪许将装置放在一个封闭的房间里，自己则在另一个房间通过望远镜观测。他测量了两个大铅球如何通过引力吸引两个小铅球，使悬挂它们的金属丝发生极其微小的“扭转”。他的测量结果精确得惊人，与现代数值的误差仅为1%左右。",
    "text_en": "The apparatus was originally designed by John Michell, who died before using it. Cavendish inherited and refined it. The experiment was excruciatingly difficult because the gravitational force between the lead balls was tiny (about 1/50,000 the weight of a grain of sand). Any air current or vibration would ruin it. To isolate the device, Cavendish placed it in a sealed room and observed it from outside through a telescope. He measured how two large lead spheres attracted two small ones, causing the wire holding them to 'twist' slightly. His precision was astounding, coming within 1% of the modern value.",

      "text_en": "Cavendish was one of the most reclusive and shy scientists in history. He barely spoke to anyone (communicating with his female servants via notes) and rarely published. Many of his great electrical discoveries were only found in his notes by Maxwell decades after his death."

    "text_en": "Newton (`newton_gravity_1687`) said 'everything has gravity'. This means your pencil and eraser attract each other, but the force is too weak to feel.\nCavendish built a super-sensitive 'swing' (torsion balance) with two small lead balls. When he brought two giant lead balls near them, the big balls actually *pulled* the small ones, causing the swing to twist!\nBy measuring this twist, he calculated exactly how strong gravity is. He then used this to figure out: if lead balls pull this hard, and the Earth pulls *that* hard (weight), how heavy must the Earth be? He successfully 'weighed the Earth'.",

Upon inhaling Nitrous Oxide (N₂O), he experienced a state of euphoria (coining the term 'Laughing Gas') and, crucially, noted its powerful 'anesthetic' properties, observing that it 'destroyed physical pain'.

      "text_en": "Davy's 1799 experiments were incredibly reckless. Nitrous Oxide was believed to be deadly, like carbon monoxide. To test this, Davy first gave it to animals, and when they survived, he proceeded to inhale it himself. He famously reported 'a highly pleasurable thrill... attended by a... vivid state of sensation... I danced about the laboratory'. He even inhaled it while suffering from a toothache (an inflamed wisdom tooth) and noted 'it appeared to mitigate the pain'. He immediately saw its potential. However, his suggestion for surgical use was ignored for over 40 years, and 'laughing gas' became a 'recreational drug' at circus sideshows and parties."

      "text": "意大利移民安东尼奥·穆奇（Antonio Meucci）在1850年代后期（据称早在1857年）就设计并建造了一台“电磁电话”，他称之为“Telettrofono”（电语音）。他建造这台设备是为了将他位于地下室的作坊与二楼卧病在床的妻子联系起来。1871年，他为自己的发明申请了“专利告诫书”(Patent Caveat)，但这只是一种临时专利。1874年，由于极度贫困（一说因实验受伤），他无力支付10美元的续费，导致告诫书失效。仅仅两年后，贝尔（`bell_telephone_1876`）提交了他自己的专利。",
      "text_en": "The Italian immigrant Antonio Meucci designed and built an 'electromagnetic telephone' in the late 1850s (reportedly as early as 1857), which he called the 'Telettrofono'. He built the device to connect his basement workshop to his wife, who was an invalid bedridden on the second floor. He filed a 'patent caveat' (a temporary patent) in 1871, but in 1874, due to extreme poverty (and injuries from an explosion), he failed to pay the $10 renewal fee, and the caveat lapsed. Just two years later, Bell (`bell_telephone_1876`) filed his patent.",

      "text_en": "Meucci's device worked on the 'electromagnetic' principle (`faraday_induction_1831`), the same as Bell's patent and Gray's design. He built his first model (reportedly) in 1857. In 1871, he filed his caveat and tried to demonstrate his invention to Western Union, but his models were (allegedly) 'lost'. In 1874, he couldn't afford the $10 renewal. In 1876, Alexander Graham Bell (who was working in a lab funded by Western Union) filed his formal patent. Meucci sued Bell, but died before the case was resolved. In 2002, the U.S. Congress passed Resolution 269, formally recognizing Meucci's historic contributions to the invention of the telephone."

He was poor, so in 1871, he only filed a 'temporary patent'. When that 'temporary' status *expired* in 1874 because he couldn't pay the $10 renewal fee, Bell swooped in two years later with a mathematically similar design, filed a *full* patent, and won the race.",
